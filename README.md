Project Problem Statement: Predicting Customer Churn in the Telecommunication Industry
Background
Customer churn is the rate at which customers stop using a company’s services. For telecommunications companies, high churn rates lead to significant revenue loss and lower customer satisfaction. The ability to predict customer churn allows companies to proactively implement strategies to retain customers.

Objective
Develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on historical data, identifies key factors influencing churn, and provides actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:

Customer Demographics: Information such as age, gender, and location.
Services Subscribed: Types of services the customer has subscribed to, like internet, phone, and TV packages.
Billing Information: Monthly charges, payment methods, etc.
Customer Tenure: Contract duration, tenure with the company, etc.
Churn Status: Target variable indicating whether the customer has churned.
Tasks Breakdown
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual feature distributions (e.g., age, tenure) using histograms, boxplots, and descriptive statistics.
Bivariate Analysis: Identify relationships between features and churn using correlation heatmaps, group-by statistics, and scatterplots.
Churn Distribution: Examine the proportion of customers who churned versus those who didn’t to gauge data balance.
Step 2: Data Cleaning

Handle Missing Values: Use imputation techniques (e.g., median for numerical values, mode for categorical ones) or remove rows/columns with excessive missing values.
Outliers: Use IQR (Interquartile Range) or z-scores to identify and handle outliers as appropriate.
Categorical Variables: Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding for nominal data or label encoding for ordinal data.
Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure models that rely on distance calculations (e.g., SVM, KNN) perform well.
Step 3: Feature Engineering

Feature Derivation: Create new features such as tenure categories (short, medium, long tenure), total monthly expenditure, and interaction terms based on service combinations.
Encoding Complex Interactions: Derive interaction features between payment methods, contract type, and service packages to capture complex behaviors affecting churn.
2. Model Selection and Training
Step 1: Choose Models

Test multiple classification algorithms:
Logistic Regression: Provides probabilistic predictions and interpretability.
Decision Trees/Random Forest: Helps identify feature importance and handles non-linearity.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Works well in high-dimensional spaces.
Gradient Boosting Models: Use XGBoost or LightGBM for robust predictions.
Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning

Apply cross-validation (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to get reliable performance estimates.
Use Grid Search or Randomized Search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize each model’s performance.
Step 3: Select Evaluation Metrics

Since churn might be imbalanced, prioritize:
Recall: Focus on capturing as many churned customers as possible.
Precision: Important if resources are limited and we want only high-certainty cases.
F1-Score: Balances precision and recall.
ROC-AUC: Evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between churned and non-churned customers.
3. Model Evaluation and Interpretation
Step 1: Evaluate Model Performance

Use the following metrics:
Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC: Use these metrics for a holistic evaluation of model performance.
Step 2: Interpret Key Factors Influencing Churn

Feature Importance: Use feature importance from tree-based models or coefficients from logistic regression to identify top factors influencing churn.
Partial Dependence Plots: Show how each feature affects the probability of churn while keeping others constant.
SHAP Values: Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model-agnostic interpretation to understand each feature’s impact on individual predictions.
Step 3: Address Model Generalization and Overfitting

Regularization techniques (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization in logistic regression) or model selection based on validation results can help prevent overfitting.
4. Recommendations and Deployment
Step 1: Generate Actionable Insights

Based on the model findings, identify factors like high monthly charges, short tenure, and specific service combinations as potential churn indicators.
Highlight actionable areas for retention strategies, such as offering discounts or improving service quality for high-risk customers.
Step 2: Provide Churn Reduction Strategies

Personalized Offers: Target at-risk customers with offers, discounts, or loyalty programs.
Improved Customer Support: Ensure consistent and effective support for high-risk customers.
Proactive Engagement: For customers on short-term contracts or with high bills, initiate contact early to address potential issues.
Step 3: Documentation and Presentation

Prepare a detailed Jupyter notebook covering the data analysis, model development, evaluation, and insights.
Create presentation slides summarizing key findings, model performance, identified churn factors, and actionable recommendations.
Ethical Considerations
Ensure ethical considerations in predictive modeling, like ensuring fairness (e.g., no bias against specific demographic groups) and transparency in the use of customer data.
